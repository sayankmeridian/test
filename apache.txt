(Note: If you use Windows machine then use "WinScp" to copy the download source code software into EC2 linux machine)
From local terminal copy the source code(Mac) :
localhost # scp -i KS-Origin.pem /tmp/Downloads/httpd-2.4.38.tar.gz ec2-user@99.44.33.33:/tmp

-->Virtual configurations
-->Document root directory (static content deploys ex: /var/www/html/)
-->Logs Path (access_log and error_log : /usr/local/apache2.4 ex: /vat/log/httpd/ )

-->Use as workload balancing (plugin/modules/virtualhost configuration)
-->SSL configurations using (certificate)

             • NameBased virtualhost and IP based virtualhost
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Apache is also has a major advantage, that it can support multiple website hosting on a single server. There are actually two types of hosting :-

1- IP address based hosting– For IP based hosting, we need to have a different IP for every website that we are hosting. These IPs are then attached to a single or multiple NICs.

2- Name based Virtual hosting– Name based hosting is used to host multiple virtual websites using a single IP address.
